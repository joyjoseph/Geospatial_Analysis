## Geospatial analysis


### Background of Challenge

There is a growing interest in the Nigerian health sector in recent years. Although the health sector
has seen advancement in their processes, there remains a gap in the use of spatial analysis in
providing locational insight which will enhance optimal resource allocation and service delivery.
In the region of Borno, the health system has suffered significant deterioration due to ongoing
conflict. Primary care services are inadequate, referrals are difficult to make, and hospitals are
overwhelmed with patients. As a result, the local population has limited access to healthcare
services.

Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of organizations addressing these urgent needs, leading to
significant gaps in essential health services. The overall situation in Borno highlights the urgent need
for comprehensive and improved healthcare intervention and optimized resource distribution.
You have been invited as a Geospatial Data Scientist intern to analyse the available datasets that can
guide a developmental agency in making the most suitable decisions for intervention to improve
access to healthcare for the people in the state. The agency would like to understand the
distribution of facilities that are in high-risk areas for mobilization of adequate security and the risk
profile of the different population groups due to inadequate access to healthcare.
Please note the following:

### Tool used for the analysis

The tool used for the analysis is Geopandas for Geospatial analysis

### What is the structure of the dataset?

There are four datasets provided: conflict, health facilities, population density and admin boundary. Which is used to extract and analyze the data that is specific to Borno State, and used for final analysis, visualization and story-telling.
